# Reports

```sh
azdocs report --format md|html|csv|xlsx|all  [--snapshot <id|latest>] [--out <dir>]
```

Reports are generated from the stored snapshot — no network access. Everything
lands under `./output/` by default:

| Format | Output | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `md` | `output/docs/` | Markdown docs tree (works in any Git host or wiki) |
| `html` | `output/report.html` + `output/docs-html/` | Single self-contained report **and** a multi-page HTML site |
| `csv` | `output/inventory.csv`, `output/findings.csv` | Flat exports |
| `xlsx` | `output/azdocs.xlsx` | Summary, Inventory (autofilter), Findings (severity colours), one sheet per category |

## The docs tree

```
output/docs/
├── index.md                     # estate summary: counts, types, locations, tag coverage
├── findings.md                  # all findings grouped by severity
├── networking.md  compute.md  … # per-category query result tables
├── subscriptions/<name>.md      # per-subscription inventory by resource group
└── resources/<sub>/<rg>.md      # per-resource detail pages
```

The **detail pages** are the deep end: one section per resource with a
settings table flattened from its properties, warning callouts for findings on
that resource, and related-resource links derived from the relationship edges.

## The HTML report

`output/report.html` is one self-contained file (inline CSS/JS, dark-mode
aware) with severity badges and client-side table filtering — suitable for
email or SharePoint. `output/docs-html/` is the docs tree as static HTML with
navigation.
